# LoreView

## Overview
**LoreView** is an innovative extension for watching movies and TV series that provides users with detailed information about the on-screen world. Using artificial intelligence and data analysis, the application recognizes characters, objects, and scene context in real time, allowing users to access additional information about characters, locations, and plot events.

For example, while watching *Game of Thrones*, a user sees an unfamiliar character and asks, "Who is this character?" LoreView analyzes the movie frame, identifies the character, and displays contextual information, such as their backstory, relationships, and key events they participated in.

## Features
- **Character and object recognition on screen** – ML models analyze video frames, identify characters, and provide users with detailed information.
- **Integration with movies and TV series** – Users can upload video files along with related sources (books, scripts, additional materials).
- **Interactive Q&A** – Users can ask questions about characters, locations, and events on screen.
- **Contextual subtitles and overlays** – Information is displayed as subtitles or an interactive overlay on the screen.
- **Automated knowledge base** – The system creates an encyclopedia of the cinematic world based on analyzed productions.
- **API for creators and film researchers** – LoreView can be used to analyze scripts and film trends.

## Additional Features
- **Tracking plot changes** – The application can analyze character relationships throughout the movie/series.
- **Synchronization with multiple data sources** – Possible integration with IMDb, Wikipedia, and fan databases.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) mode** – Information can be displayed in AR, e.g., on a smartphone or VR headset.
- **Personalized recommendations** – Analyzing user interests to deliver personalized content.
- **Detection of symbolism and cultural references** – Scene analysis for hidden meanings.

## Business Model and Revenue Streams
- **Premium subscription** – Access to advanced features and integrations.
- **Freemium model** – Basic features for free, extended options in a paid plan.
- **Partnerships with streaming platforms** – Integration with Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max.
- **Contextual advertising** – Personalized ads based on analyzed content.
- **API access for businesses** – Selling API access to content creators and analysts.

## Market Potential
- **Growing demand for AI in media** – Automatic content analysis is becoming increasingly sought after.
- **Dynamic growth of streaming extensions** – Users seek additional features while watching content.
- **Strong fan communities** – Knowledge bases about movies and TV series are extremely popular (e.g., *Star Wars*, *Game of Thrones* fandoms).
- **Integration with new technologies** – Potential expansion into VR, AR, and interactive film experiences.

## Competition
### Direct Competitors:
- **Amazon X-Ray** – Provides additional information about actors and trivia but is limited to Amazon Prime Video.
- **IMDb and Wikipedia** – Offer extensive movie databases but require users to search manually.
- **Shazam for Movies (such as SceneIt)** – Identifies movies from short clips but lacks deep contextual information.

### Competitive Advantages:
- **Real-time AI-driven recognition** – No need to manually search for information.
- **Cross-platform compatibility** – Works with various streaming services and offline content.
- **Advanced Q&A system** – Users can ask questions and get instant, contextual responses.
- **Integration with additional sources** – Goes beyond standard movie databases to provide deep insights.

## Challenges and Risks
- **Legal and copyright concerns** – Need to ensure compliance with content ownership rights and fair use policies.
- **Technical complexity** – AI-powered real-time recognition requires high computational power and efficient models.
- **User adoption** – Convincing users to install an extension or app and integrating it seamlessly with their viewing experience.
- **Data accuracy** – Ensuring that the information provided is up-to-date and relevant.
- **Scalability** – Handling large datasets and high demand from global users.

## Recruitment
We are looking for:
- **ML/AI Engineers** – Image recognition and NLP for content analysis.
- **Backend Developers (Go, Python)** – API, integrations, data processing.
- **Frontend Developers (React, WebGL)** – Interactive user interfaces.
- **UX/UI Designers** – Designing an intuitive screen overlay.
- **Film content analysis experts** – Creating the knowledge base and AI models.

## Technical Changes for Future Development
- **Improved image analysis** – Better algorithms for character and scene recognition.
- **Enhanced NLP for user interaction** – Improving question and answer processing.
- **Automatic subtitle synchronization with character recognition** – Greater accuracy and consistency with source material.
- **API expansion for developers** – Enabling integration with other applications.

## Tech Stack
